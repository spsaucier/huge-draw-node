## HUGE Drawing by Input File

To run:
* Ensure that you have node installed and in your path
* `cd` into this project folder
* Run `node .`
* The application will take `input.txt` as input and will create `output.txt` with the canvas

To run tests:
* Follow first two steps above
* Run `node ./test.js`

There are also assertions built into the application as well, to ensure that input.txt is formatted correctly.
